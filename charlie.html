				<h2>My Journey Begins Here...</h2><br>
				<p>Hi, I'm Charlie. I'm a 6 year old Maltese/Shih-tzu mix. My Mom and Dad got me when I was a 3 month old puppy, somewhere near Hickory, North Carolina.</p><br><p>I've lived with them and my new-found sister who is a Yorkie for the past 6 years. It took her a few weeks to get used to me being around, or just allowing me to play with any of the toys, for that matter. But we've had a lot of fun and have gotten along great ever since.</p><br><p>My parents would say I have a lot of energy, love being outside, but I also love to lounge around. I'll sleep on just about anything that will serve as a pillow. They say I have a funny disposition, along with being extremely lovable. You can tell from my pics that I can be quite charming also.</p><br><p>My parents take great care of me as they make sure I go to the vet on a regular basis to get my annual shots, along with going to the groomer every couple of months. I heard they had me neutered when I was young, but I don't know what that is, and they won't speak of it. I'm in really good shape as I eat nothing but hollistic dog food and never beg for this mysterious people food I've heard about.</p><br><p>Life's been good! Unfortunately, there are a lot of things that are going to change soon which means that my Mom and Dad need to find a new home for me. They are expecting a human son in September and they are not sure that we'll get along as I can be very territorial. While I do have a lot of great attributes, as I just mentioned, I do have one vice which is the next part of telling you my story.</p>

			<h2 id="badhabitsh2">Bad Habits Are Hard to Break</h2>
			<div id="badhabitstext">
				<p>I love my owners so much that I wouldn't allow anything bad to happen to them, which is why you could say I'm a bit overprotective. Ever since I was a puppy, I have not allowed strangers in the house (strangers to me at least), but I am Ok with some of my extended family. My parents say they're in control, but I have a hard time trying to relax.</p><br><p>I have been known to lash out at a stranger that comes into our house, but in crowded environments (like the vet's office), I get so overwhelmed that I appear calm. It's strange, but it is the way I am.</p><br><p>My parents hired a professional when I was 2 to do some "in-house" training, which helped me, but didn't break my old habits. This is why they need to find me a good home free of any situations that would casue me to do harm. I may look cute (evidence directly below), which is why people find it hard to believe that I can act this way. Next, I'll tell you about my current training which is helping me to be more obedient and tame my agression as best as possible...</p>
